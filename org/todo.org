* stuff to study 

** app life cycle (Intent stuff)
** db ? 
** form validation
** 
* V2 (Improv's list)
** Store the list in a db instead of the sd card (a bit complicated)
 - [ ] ContentProvider stuff ... see http://www.vogella.de/articles/AndroidSQLite/article.html
** Create an improv editor
*** Menu basics
 - [X] Adding a menu
 - [X] Adding an entry to "Create" a new improv
*** [X] Adding an activity to fill an improv (like the detail activity)
 - [X] When saved, check the activity appears in the list
*** Edition menu 
 - [X] Clicking on an entry should edit it (go back to the acitivty)
 - [X] Pass the edited improv
 - [X] Fill the data
 - [X] When save, edit and go back to the list
** Navigate to 'game' view (with the same content provider in readable state ?) and back to list
** At this point, test on actual device !!! And try and write a list of improvs
** Possibility to delete a note (or clear out everything)
** Change the 'seconds' editor to something more usable
** Change orientation of the screen based on content
** Add 'cancel' button in edit screen
* (Improvements)
** gesture to navigate between improvs (instead of / as a complement to the buttons)
** vibration / visual alerts when milestones of the improv are reached (2', 1', 30', 10')
** variable durations for caucuses
* Various stuff
** Add the MIT license headers to all files (a script probably exists for that)
** Remove the org.bullecarree stuff..
** Rename classes, put the app on the damn android store !
** Use android conventsion (mRect, etc...) ?
