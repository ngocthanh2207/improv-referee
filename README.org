* Improv-referee

This is an android application to help play the part of the "Referee" in a type of improvisation comedy 
known as "Match d'improvisation" (more information available in French on [[http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_d'improvisation] [Wikipedia] )

The application should help : 
- keeping the list of improvs for a game (title, category, type, number of players allowed..)
- timing the improv
